A program proposed in Chapter 8 of *The Rust Programming Language* Book.  
Built to practice working with **Vectors** and **HashMaps** in Rust.

Options to run:

- `cargo run`
- `cargo build --release` -> builds an executable in target/release/ which can be run standalone


How to use:
- add employees to departments with the syntax `Add Employee to Department`
- retrieve a list of employees per department by department name (possible after the first operation)
